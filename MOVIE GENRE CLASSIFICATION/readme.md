# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings are utilized alongside classifiers like Naive Bayes.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres are collected and imported into the Python environment.
- The dataset is inspected to understand its structure and contents, including handling any missing values or inconsistencies.

### 2. Text Processing
- Textual data is preprocessed by tokenizing, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization.
- Techniques like TF-IDF are used to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
- Alternatively, word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe may be used to represent textual data.

### 3. Model Building
- Various classifiers are explored, with a focus on Naive Bayes for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- The model is trained using the processed textual features and corresponding genres.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation is performed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

### 5. Prediction
- The model is used to predict genres for new, unseen movie plot summaries.
- Predictions are compared to actual genres to validate the model further.

### 6. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions based on the model's performance are summarized.
- Potential improvements and future work are discussed to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.
