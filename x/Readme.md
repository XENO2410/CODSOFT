# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset containing information about various credit card transactions, different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests are employed to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Exploration
- The credit card transactions dataset is imported into the Python environment.
- Initial data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure and identify any inconsistencies or missing values.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values and outliers.
- Features and target variables are separated for model training.
- The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 3. Model Building
- **Logistic Regression**: A logistic regression model is built to classify transactions.
- **Decision Trees**: A decision tree classifier is employed to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Random Forests**: A random forest model, consisting of multiple decision trees, is used to improve classification accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Each model is evaluated using the testing data.
- Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the models' effectiveness.
- Comparative analysis is performed to identify the best-performing model among Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

### 5. Prediction
- The best-performing model is used to make predictions on new, unseen credit card transactions.
- Predictions are compared with actual outcomes to validate the model further.

### 6. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions based on the models' performance are summarized.
- Potential improvements and future work are discussed to enhance the models' accuracy and reliability.
